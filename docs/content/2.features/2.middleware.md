# Middleware

## `beditaAuth`

The `beditaAuth` middleware deals with session user. It read user from session and put it in shared state usable via [`useBeditaAuth()`](/features/composables#user) composable.

It is also configurable to protect routes.

::alert{type="success"}
By default this middleware is added as **global** to middleware application stack in order to set user state in every page.
::

::alert{type="info"}
If you don't care about this behavior you can configure the middleware as not global.
::

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    '@atlasconsulting/nuxt-bedita',
  ],
  bedita: {
    auth: {
      global: false,
    },
  },
})
```

### Set authentication as required

You can configure authentication as required for the whole app

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    '@atlasconsulting/nuxt-bedita',
  ],
  bedita: {
    auth: {
      required: true,
    },
  },
})
```

In this case every route of the app will be check for authenticated user. Unauthenticated users will be redirect to `unauthenticatedRedirect` property.

### Public pages

It is possible to configure a set of routes for public pages i.e. pages accessible either from authenticated user than not authenticated.

This is mostly useful when the auth middleware is configure as global and required.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    '@atlasconsulting/nuxt-bedita',
  ],
  bedita: {
    auth: {
      global: true,
      required: true,
      publicRoutes: ['/credits', '/contacts'],
    },
  },
})
```

### Routing roles guard

Sometimes you need to protect some routes so that only users with a specific role can access to those pages.

This can be done with roles guard:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    '@atlasconsulting/nuxt-bedita',
  ],
  bedita: {
    auth: {
      rolesGuard: {
        '/admin': ['admin'], // only users with admin role can access to routes that start with '/admin'
        '/manage/stuff': ['admin', 'manager'], // only users with 'admin' or 'manager' role can access
        '/profile': ['*'], // '*' means any role is authorized (all authenticated users can access to '/profile')
      },
    },
  },
})
```

::alert{type=warning}
When a user can't access to a route a 403 Forbidden error is thrown.
